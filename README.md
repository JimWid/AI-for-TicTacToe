First AI created!
Using Q-learning/reinforcement learning
I thought it was a nice project and simple, found myself into an dumb ai who only looked for winning but that doesnt stop the other player from winning either
Solution was on fixing the reward method, ties are better than losing.

Also it was crucial to record the prev-turns, to find out what moves have a better future result, for example its usually better to play on the center, or to find way to do a fork

Also it was better to make it play against also another learning AI, if we only make play against random moves, it will not improve at all

This may be an overkill but it was nice for learning!
and it was fun!
